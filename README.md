The aim of our project is to provide support to “Colour-IT” company in order to help manage the projects and monitor the progress, which includes - productivity of the employees, division of the tasks, time spent working and processes that help in achieving their goals

# About the project
A company “Colour IT” has reached out to the 1. Semester students of Software
Engineering with a task to develop and implement an IT project management system . In
addition, the company has asked to develop a website to complement the above mentioned
system (Mr. Colour, 2020).
To start off, it is important to understand what exactly is the project management
system, why is it important, why there is a need for such, and what are the main challenges in
creating one.
Project management system is the tool that helps organizations in planning, organizing,
tracking, scheduling and improving the work. It can assist in preparing for difficult projects
and also improve productivity of the company as a whole (Vartika Kashyap, 2020).
Due to the given time restrictions, as well as the fact that the project is carried out by
the first semester students with little to no programming experience, the project is not going
to include a complicated system with a database. This being said, the system that the team
will develop is a basic and simple single user system (ColorIT - The interview ).
